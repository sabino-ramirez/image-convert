# image-convert
Converts PPM image file to gray-scale, ordered dithering, indexed gray scale, or quantized rgb format without using built-in image classes. 

There is a pom.xml file becasue I did not use eclipse as I was testing to see how maven works. 
Images and other tools provided in projUtils folder.
